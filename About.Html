        <h2>Who is Jospeter?</h2>
        <P>Hello,I'm Jospeter Karani .I completed my High school Education back in 2018 and was able to attain a mean grade of C- of 45 points missing a point to get C+ but I thank God. Early 2019 I joined a tertiary institution to further my studies and adventure in my passion in Information and Technology where I learnt tramendous skills on the same. Since then I have been looking forward to have a stable income to join university but due financial Crisis I wasn't able. Later in 2021 I started transcription which did not go very well and my account was locked. Not giving up I opened another one and continued doing transcription but it was not paying so I lost the motivation along. Come end of 2021 I got am email from the school I was studying(Kibera Township Centre) concerning Online work which made me very happy. I filled the provided form and hoped to be among the shortlisted .Again the first phase was called and I wasn't among them but my IT instructor encourage me by stating their was a second and a third phase, Finally I got a chance and I was able to attend all the classes in person for 10 days. Finally I was able to open an upwork account and I was very happy by then.Tasks have been hard since then but I'm happy as I write this that I have been able to learn a few tactics on online work differently to what I had thought sometimes back.Currently adventuring in blogs,article writing and Websites development.</P>
